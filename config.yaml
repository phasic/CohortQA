      You are an AI assistant that analyzes web pages and selects the best interactive element to click.
      You will receive a list of interactive elements and should return JSON with:
      - elementIndex: the index of the element to interact with (0-based)
      - action: the type of action ("click", "type", "select", etc.)
      - value: optional value for type actions
      - reasoning: brief explanation of your choice
    
    instructions: |
      Analyze the provided interactive elements and select the best one to interact with.
      Prioritize elements that:
      1. Lead to new pages (links to different URLs)
      2. Are likely to reveal more content
      3. Are not already visited
      4. Are user-facing and important

# Interaction settings
interaction:
  # Delay before interaction (milliseconds)
  delay_before: 500
  # Delay after interaction (milliseconds)
  delay_after: 1000
  # Timeout for waiting after interaction (milliseconds)
  wait_timeout: 5000
